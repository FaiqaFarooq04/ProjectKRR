This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

📌 AI-Based Learning System using Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KRR)

📖 Project Overview
This project presents an AI-based educational system designed using Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) to enhance students' critical thinking and logical reasoning skills.

🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional educational platforms primarily encourage rote memorization rather than conceptual understanding and reasoning. This limits students’ analytical abilities and problem-solving skills.
The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent learning system that:
Analyzes student responses
Adapts difficulty levels
Provides personalized feedback
Promotes logic-based learning using AI reasoning techniques

🧠 Methodology (KRR Approach)
The system is built using rule-based Knowledge Representation & Reasoning, where predefined IF–THEN rules evaluate student performance and dynamically adjust the learning experience.
Example Reasoning Rules:
IF answer is correct AND response time is fast → Increase difficulty
IF the game session starts → load the first question
IF question answered → assign appropriate feedback

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KRR)
Rule-Based Logic (IF–THEN Rules)
Conceptual Dataset Design
Microsoft PowerPoint & Word (Documentation)

⚙️ System Features
Adaptive Question Difficulty
Intelligent Feedback System
Logical Decision-Making Model

🔗 Future Improvements
Integration with Machine Learning for predictive learning paths
Real-time student analytics dashboard
Enhanced reasoning engine with dynamic rule generation
