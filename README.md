##📌 AI-Based Learning System using Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KRR)

📖 Project Overview

This project presents an AI-based educational system designed using Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) to enhance students' critical thinking and logical reasoning skills.

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional educational platforms primarily encourage rote memorization rather than conceptual understanding and reasoning. This limits students’ analytical abilities and problem-solving skills.
The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent learning system that:

Analyzes student responses

Adapts difficulty levels

Provides personalized feedback

Promotes logic-based learning using AI reasoning techniques

🧠 Methodology (KRR Approach)

The system is built using rule-based Knowledge Representation & Reasoning, where predefined IF–THEN rules evaluate student performance and dynamically adjust the learning experience.

Example Reasoning Rules:

IF answer is correct AND response time is fast → Increase difficulty

IF the game session starts → load the first question

IF question answered → assign appropriate feedback
